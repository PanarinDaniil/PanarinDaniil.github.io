					<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
					<div class="h2-SubHeading">All the fine print</div>
					<p>Code-Buddy.COM (“Code-Buddy”, “WE” OR “US”) USER TERMS OF SERVICE</p>
					<p>The terms and conditions set forth below (the “terms”) govern your use of this site on the world wide web. These terms are a legal contract between you and Code-Buddy and govern your access to, and use of, Code-Buddy website located at the URL: https://www.Code-Buddy.com as well as all associated sites linked to http://Code-Buddy.com by Code-Buddy, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, together with the services available through this site (the “site”). If you do not agree with any of these terms, do not access or otherwise use this site, any services available through this site or any information contained on this site. Your use of this site shall be deemed to be your agreement to abide by each of the terms set forth below. If you are using this site for your company’s use, you represent that you are an authorized representative who has the authority to legally bind your company to these terms and to grant Code-Buddy the necessary permission to make changes to your company’s website. Code-Buddy may make changes to the content and services offered on this site at any time. Code-Buddy may also change, modify or add or remove provisions of these terms at any time by posting updated terms of use on this site. If any change, modification, additional provision or removal of a provision is unacceptable to you, you shall cease using this site. If you instead continue to use this site, you will be conclusively deemed to have accepted the change.</p>
					<p>Note: this agreement contains a dispute resolution and arbitration provision, including class action waiver that affects your rights under this agreement and with respect to disputes you may have with Code-Buddy. You may opt out of the binding individual arbitration and class action waiver as provided below.</p>
					<p>1. HOW OUR SERVICES WORK</p>
					<p>Code-Buddy offers a Marketplace for customizing websites. We connect website and business owners (“Users”) who need to update their existing websites or other coding services, with web developers (“Developers”) who are able to make these updates for Users. For example, our Site can connect Users with a Developer who can, for example, insert a logo on a website, add social networking plug-ins, or update existing content.</p>
					<p>Users can submit a project request for website updates – herein called a “Project” – with us and request a quote for a Project by visiting https://www.Code-Buddy.com/projects/new and submitting a description of the items they would like to change. We break each Project into a series smaller projects or “Tweaks,” and provide the User a quote for completing the entire Project, based on the individual Tweaks that are needed to complete the Project. Each Tweak is allocated to a Developer for completion.</p>
					<p>So that a Developer may Tweak your website as requested, and/or complete your Project, you must supply us with the appropriate login credentials for your website and permit Developers temporary access in order to complete your Project. Developers are not permitted to use your log-in credentials for any purposes other than to complete the Tweaks or Project. You must have the authority to authorize Code-Buddy and/or Developers to access your website in order to perform the requested services, or you may not submit a Project request.</p>
					<p>Developers are independent contractors of Code-Buddy, not employees, and as such are responsible for the services provided to Users.</p>
